# Changelog

## v2.0 (unreleased)
**first forked version of the termbox library**

### Changed
 - replaced waf build system with CMake as it is more popular and therefore
   better supported.
 - Added `clang-format` based auto formatter to ensure a consistent code-style.
 - Added `clang-tidy` to catch as many code-smells as possible. 

----

## v1.1.2:

- Properly include changelog into the tagged version commit. I.e. I messed up
  by tagging v1.1.1 and describing it in changelog after tagged commit. This
  commit marked as v1.1.2 includes changelog for both v1.1.1 and v1.1.2. There
  are no code changes in this minor release.

## v1.1.1:

- Ncurses 6.1 compatibility fix. See https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go/issues/185.


## v1.1.0:

- API: tb_width() and tb_height() are guaranteed to be negative if the termbox
  wasn't initialized.
- API: Output mode switching is now possible, adds 256-color and grayscale color
  modes.
- API: Better tb_blit() function. Thanks, Gunnar ZÃ¶tl <gz@tset.de>.
- API: New tb_cell_buffer() function for direct back buffer access.
- API: Add new init function variants which allow using arbitrary file
  descriptor as a terminal.
- Improvements in input handling code.
- Calling tb_shutdown() twice is detected and results in abort() to discourage
  doing so.
- Mouse event handling is ported from termbox-go.
- Paint demo port from termbox-go to demonstrate mouse handling capabilities.
- Bug fixes in code and documentation.

## v1.0.0:

- Remove the Go directory. People generally know about termbox-go and where
  to look for it.
- Remove old terminfo-related python scripts and backport the new one from
  termbox-go.
- Remove cmake/make-based build scripts, use waf.
- Add a simple terminfo database parser. Now termbox prefers using the
  terminfo database if it can be found. Otherwise it still has a fallback
  built-in database for most popular terminals.
- Some internal code cleanups and refactorings. The most important change is
  that termbox doesn't leak meaningless exported symbols like 'keys' and
  'funcs' now. Only the ones that have 'tb_' as a prefix are being exported.
- API: Remove unsigned ints, use plain ints instead.
- API: Rename UTF-8 functions 'utf8_*' -> 'tb_utf8_*'.
- API: TB_DEFAULT equals 0 now, it means you can use attributes alones
  assuming the default color.
- API: Add TB_REVERSE.
- API: Add TB_INPUT_CURRENT.
- Move python module to its own directory and update it due to changes in the
  termbox library.
